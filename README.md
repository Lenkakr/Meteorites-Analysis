# Meteorites Analysis Using NASA API


In this project, we used NASA API data that cover all meteorites that have ever fallen on the surface of the Earth.

After the data cleaning, we used interactive visualization libraries like Plotly to show how many meteorites were found each year, what was their size distribution, and also where they were found geographically.

Other libraries used: Requests, Json, Pandas, Datetime, NumPy, Seaborn.
